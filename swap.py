# Swapping Numbers Program
# Taking input from user
a = eval(input("Enter a Number for a: "))
b = eval(input("Enter a Number for b: "))
# Printing numbers when they are unswapped
print("Before Swapping.......")
print("a is ",a)
print("b is ",b)
# Swap Logic
a,b = b,a
# Printing numbers when they are swapped
print("After Swapping........")
print("a is ",a)
print("b is ",b)
